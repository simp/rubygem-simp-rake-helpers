## [2.0.0](https://github.com/voxpupuli/rspec-puppet-facts/tree/2.0.0) (2020-08-05)

- Require Ruby >= 2.4
- Automatically find the latest facter version in the database. Previously a
  very slow and undeterministic approach was taken when an exact match of the
  Facter version wasn't found.. The new approach is to take the closest version
  that is still older than the specified version.
- Fix Amazon Linux 2 fact lookup
- Log which facts could not be found
- Remove json as a dependency

## 2019-12-11 - Release 1.10.0
- Automatically select the default Facter version based on the Puppet version.
  The available Puppet version is matched against a mapping of Puppet and
  Facter versions included in the `puppet-agent` all-in-one packages to find
  the most suitable Facter version.

## 2019-07-31 - Release 1.9.6
- Suppress the warning message generated when the Augeas gem is not available.
- Searching through older Facter releases for a fact set that does not exist no
  longer causes it to hang indefinitely.
- The `operatingsystemrelease` values are now correctly escaped when building
  the FacterDB filters, allowing the use of `operatingsystemrelease` values
  that contain special regular expression characters like parentheses.

## 2019-07-29 - Release 1.9.5
- The default version of Facter to search for is now configurable with
  `RSpec.configuration.default_facter_version`.
- When passing a `:supported_os` hash to `on_supported_os()`, single
  `operatingsystemrelease` values can now be specified as a String rather than
  an Array with a single String.
- Dependency on the `mcollective-client` gem removed. The `mco_version` fact
  will now optionally be set if the gem is installed.
- The fact names can now be provided to tests as Strings instead of Symbols by
  setting `RSpec.configuration.facterdb_string_keys` to `true`.
- Dropped support for Ruby < 2.1.0

## 2019-03-22 - Release 1.9.4
- Take two on getting rubygems autodeploy going. So much for docs,
    looking at other projects for this one.
## 2019-03-22 - Release 1.9.3
- Various CI updates - [Garrett Honeycutt](https://github.com/ghoneycutt/)
- Symbolize hash keys in `register_custom_fact`
